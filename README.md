# AI Call Insights Analyzer

### About The Project

This is a full-stack web application built to demonstrate how modern AI can be used to automatically analyze and pull useful information from a simple phone call recording.

The app takes a sample audio file and performs three key AI tasks:
1.  **Transcription:** It uses OpenAI's Whisper to get a full, accurate text transcript of the conversation.
2.  **Sentiment Analysis:** It analyzes the text to figure out if the overall tone of the call was positive or negative.
3.  **Summarization:** It creates a quick summary so you can understand what the call was about without reading the whole thing.
